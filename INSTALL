Bookz depends on:
    - django 1.3
    - BeautifulSoup

install django 1.3 with your preferred package management system, or manually:
    wget http://www.djangoproject.com/download/1.3.1/tarball/
    tar xzvf Django-1.3.tar.gz
    cd Django-1.3
    sudo python setup.py install

get and install BeautifulSoup. It's in PIP, or here: 
    http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/

now go to the "books" directory, and copy settings-example.py to settings.py
    now edit the database settings in settings.py if you have to,
    edit the ISBNDB.com-APIKey, maybe edit some other things.
    remember that if you have DEBUG=False, you have to configure your webserver to deliver static content.

Once you got the basic settings, run "python manage.py syncdb" to build the db scheme.
    the scipt will als you to create a superuser.
    do so.

Now you can just run "python manage.py runserver" to run a developement server on localhost:8000.

If you plan to go online in the wild, you would of course use a "real" webserver via mod_wsgi.

USAGE:
    use the superuser you created during the install to log into localhost:8000/admin - explore
    some features are only accessible (and visible) when you are logged in.
    logged in users can:
        - add books (with autors, subjects, and publishers. those will automatically be added on first encounter.)
        - edit books, autors, subjects, publishers, and their own profile
        - write reviews on books
        - write comments on reviews
    superusers can:
        - do everything, using the admin.
