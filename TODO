TODO:
    - a search-as-you-type searchengine (xapian+django-haystack+jQuery-Autocomplete?)
    - provide a filter mechanism and/or pager for the books
    - extend both internal and external API (could also help with the former and the latter)
    - AJAXify the forms
    - Test cases! We are far away from decent test coverage
    - more importers
    - social features (how much kilograms of books do I have? compete with others! tweet it!)
    - logo and favicon
